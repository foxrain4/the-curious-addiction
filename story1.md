[p][size=18px]Granny whispered, leaning closer, "You can take a break if you want."[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Your scrawny body and dripping sweat mixed with tears, "Can't leave you to do all of the work."[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Scratch, scratch, and scratch,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]you scythed through the yellow fields of abundance[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]every year, on this month,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]all the villagers get busy[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]In mid-September, the sun's heat feels especially relentless, scorching everything in its path.[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Nanny plucked the plunder into straw beds and loaded them onto carriages.[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]And, mind you,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]We have no horses[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]We are the "horses"[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]We pulled the big and silly old wagon through the densely packed forests,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]heading down a secretive and narrowing earth pathway,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]until we can no longer see the entrance of this hidden dungeon[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]_________________________________[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Nanny held your hands, "It's dangerous out there."[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]You shrugged with unhappiness, "I don't believe in the outlandish rumors."[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Nanny (Hands over a scythe): Still dangerous alone[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]The super crowded hidden dungeon has a low ceiling and many busy noises from the incoming [/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]settlers.[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]You: It's squeezy, hot, and I can't breathe in here[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Nanny: And there's no shower[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Together: For one whole month![/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]You bid farewell to your tough grandma and started exploring the wilderness.[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]It is said that the Far East has pleasant towns.[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]But too many long blades of grass fields are sheathing the view.[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Only when you stop cutting through the grass,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]then could you hear[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]low growls[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]and stealthy footsteps,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]you are not alone[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]_________________________________[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]When you had almost reached your destination,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]A long river dashed your hopes,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]and on your forested side,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]wolves with giant white furs were gathering in strength and hunger[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Stuck in the middle,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]all alone[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]You: Should've listened to the nanny[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]The beautiful city walled by the river seems to be calling for you,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]opulent mansions and purple grapevines silhouetted like a wall painting[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Flinging your scythe at the wolves hiding near the bushes makes them panic and fall back for a [/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]few seconds.[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Taking the opportunity,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]you dive into the blue river, unaware of any dangerous presence lurking beneath your waist[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Luckily, your muscles didn't let you drown.[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]You reached the dream port town, and everything is sparkling new,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]marble streets,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]wall with vibrant colors,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]multi-story brick mansions[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Ship merchants that came to your small village have always told of their port town,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]but none of their words could paint such a beautiful image that you are seeing today[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]_________________________________[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]When the sun has dried your clothes,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]and your skin turned into flakes[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]You: I need a place to sit[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]But as you kept walking, you could see no sight of a resting place... nor people.[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]You: Where is everyone?[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]There were loud barks at you.[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Wolves can't possibly swim, can they?[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Your legs become numb, and you spin around your torso like a tree-climbing lizard,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]it's just dogs[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Their noises were dramatized by the silence of this eerily silent town.[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Looking at the coins in your palms,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]you realized they were of no use[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]You: Maybe the town citizens believed in the werewolf rumors, too. Why else would they leave [/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]this fantastical place?[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]You become hysterical with nobody to chat with, and the whole werewolf legend slowly sips [/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]past your mind.[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Initially forced to survive,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]you barged into other residences and ate some loaves of bread,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]then, you took some grape juice,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]and today, you are smoking some ham[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]The thieving adrenaline has turned into boredom exploration.[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]You: Maybe it is time to head back[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]You: It's been many days, the wolves would have been gone away by now[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]_________________________________[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Stealing a small merchant canoe, you unwittingly became a pirate.[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Astoundingly, the wolves were still here[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]But they have turned into carcasses,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]but their big white fur is still attached,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]usually, hunters would sell that for a hefty coin bag,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]whoever did it was desperate[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]or, wasn't human[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]The crazy wind was whipping against the reddening trees,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]You: Should I move back?[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]A creepy voice called out your name from the bushes,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]nobody should know your name around here,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]all of your home villagers should be hanging out at the hidden dungeon[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Your curiosity was piqued, and you stepped closer and closer.[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]A black arm shoved in front of your face from the bushes.[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]You can't make out what you are seeing until it starts talking.[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Ash: Do not return home[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Holy, your friend has been massacred by a wild pack of animals,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]You don't even dare to bring him back home, afraid of splitting his injured body apart.[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]You (Anger): What happened? Who did this to you?[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Ash: The legend is true. And now the werewolves know our secret hideout.[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Ash used the nearby scythe and ended his life.[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Afraid of your life, you took the scythe and shouldered on.[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]_________________________________[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]As you walked back to your tiny canoe,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]you started thinking about all the possibilities that have gone wrong,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]your footsteps led the werewolves into the secret house[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]You: Unlikely, because I am skinny and leave almost no footprints[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Your smell lingered in the air, and then the werewolves traced it.[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]You: No, because I am heading in the opposite direction[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]the hot September plus the no shower plus crowding with many unwashed villagers has created [/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]a stench for you,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]that leads the demons back into your backyard[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Sniffing your sleeves,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]You: Possible[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Tightening your scythe, you know you cannot abandon your people.[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]No matter what had happened[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Jogging in the darkness with the canopy's shroud,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]you stopped hesitating and prowled your way back home[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Hiding behind a giant trunk,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]images of werewolves twice as tall as you,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]were damaging the villages,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]they were enraged,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]that is good because it means they have not found the secret basement yet[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Four red eyes hiding inside bushes tracking this lone scythe-wielder[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]...[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]_________________________________[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]A dense fog started crawling on four sides of the forest,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]taking the opportunity, you headed back into safety.[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Banging onto the metallic door, the door finally swung open,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]you and two more lost villagers followed you into the hut,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]one elderly required you to explain your bloody scythe,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]and when you explained about the werewolf attack, his eyes became bigger[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Elderly Ion: Lock the gate, and do not let anyone in anymore[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Children: What's happening[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Elderly Ion: The werewolves are here[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]At night, the sanctuary turned into a crime scene,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]some villagers have gone missing,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]they have banned torches and lamps for it would make the hut visible to the enemies,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]but in this darkness,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]they can't tell if the enemies have infiltrated the yard[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]You walked with the volunteer "guards" to surveil any threats,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]but everyone looked dirty with some blood[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]You: This isn't working, but there were two that came into the hut with me on the last entry[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Guards (Pointing finger): Is it them?[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Realizing the guards and scythe-wielder are heading in their direction,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]the tall humans sprung into werewolves,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]their muscles trembling with nervousness[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]_________________________________[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]RUFF RUFF !![/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]RUFF RUFF !![/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]The loud sounds traveled past the doors.[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]You penetrated your scythe into one of them, and the organs spilled out.[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]The other guards held onto the other werewolf, and a knife was stabbed into its abdomen.[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]It was no longer a safe house,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]everyone went mad and opened the doors,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]watery mist and lost villagers were jumping beans[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]You couldn't find your nanny in this dark place or the foggy outside,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]you are left with no choice except for self-preservation[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]But your legs are frozen with fear of what is going to happen to your poor old nanny then,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]your mind has taken over control of your unwilling body[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]You: If I have to die, let it be worth[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]With a last, shivering breath, you screamed like a night hawk.[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]The sound vibrations pierced through the eardrums of the merciless beasts,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]they let go of their bounty and went straight for your head[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Even in the foggy mist, you can feel footsteps closing towards you.[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Spinning like a Beyblade, your scythe was able to slice through some foes,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]but the shadows in the mist became more and more[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]_________________________________[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]The day broke, and the mist barrier was disappearing.[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Finally, standing face to face the nightmarish faces,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Zip Zip Zip[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Zip Zip Zip[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]The sound of metal arrows was launched,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]The werewolves flinched backward with their hairy chests full of stabs.[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]You quickly squatted down into the descending mist and headed toward the yellow fields,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]All by yourself[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Quiet as a cricket[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Step by step, you continued marching further away.[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]When you looked upwards,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]a shiny sword pointed toward your throat,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]you smiled gracefully at the holy knight[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]The men smiled and knew you were not a shapeshifting werewolf,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]otherwise, you would not be smiling[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Then you frowned[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]You: My nanny![/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]The knight heaved his horse and rode back into the battle zone, unassumingly to find your [/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]nanny.[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]When you continued to explore the yellow maze,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]you found your granny[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Cut cut cut cut cut[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Cut cut cut cut cut[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]You: Nanny?[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Nanny with her six-packs[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Nanny and her long poking ears,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Nanny and her large mouth and protruding jaws,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Granny: What?[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Together, you continued to help Granny clear the weeds.[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]_________________________________[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]Inside the hidden dungeon,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]The guards managed to slew a few werewolves,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]but the guards were kids, after all,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]when the mightiest werewolves stepped into the corona,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]they were quickly fallen,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]the tall and ancient werewolf grabbed the best-dressed guard up into the air,[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]unable to move[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]"Ancient One": Do you want to be a werewolf?[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]It spoke like a wolf trying to speak the human language.[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px]The end[/size][/p]

[p][size=18px].[/size][/p]
