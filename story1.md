Six-pack granny (Werewolf)
Description: A werewolf game.






Granny whispered, leaning closer, "You can take a break if you want."


Your scrawny body and dripping sweat mixed with tears, "Can't leave you to do all of the work."


Scratch, scratch, and scratch,


you scythed through the yellow fields of abundance


every year, on this month,


all the villagers get busy


In mid-September, the sun's heat feels especially relentless, scorching everything in its path.


Nanny plucked the plunder into straw beds and loaded them onto carriages.


And, mind you,


We have no horses


We are the "horses"


We pulled the big and silly old wagon through the densely packed forests,


heading down a secretive and narrowing earth pathway,


until we can no longer see the entrance of this hidden dungeon


_________________________________


Nanny held your hands, "It's dangerous out there."


You shrugged with unhappiness, "I don't believe in the outlandish rumors."


Nanny (Hands over a scythe): Still dangerous alone


The super crowded hidden dungeon has a low ceiling and many busy noises from the incoming


settlers.


You: It's squeezy, hot, and I can't breathe in here


Nanny: And there's no shower


Together: For one whole month!


You bid farewell to your tough grandma and started exploring the wilderness.


It is said that the Far East has pleasant towns.


But too many long blades of grass fields are sheathing the view.


Only when you stop cutting through the grass,


then could you hear


low growls


and stealthy footsteps,


you are not alone


_________________________________


When you had almost reached your destination,


A long river dashed your hopes,


and on your forested side,


wolves with giant white furs were gathering in strength and hunger


Stuck in the middle,


all alone


You: Should've listened to the nanny


The beautiful city walled by the river seems to be calling for you,


opulent mansions and purple grapevines silhouetted like a wall painting


Flinging your scythe at the wolves hiding near the bushes makes them panic and fall back for a


few seconds.


Taking the opportunity,


you dive into the blue river, unaware of any dangerous presence lurking beneath your waist


Luckily, your muscles didn't let you drown.


You reached the dream port town, and everything is sparkling new,


marble streets,


wall with vibrant colors,


multi-story brick mansions


Ship merchants that came to your small village have always told of their port town,


but none of their words could paint such a beautiful image that you are seeing today


_________________________________


When the sun has dried your clothes,


and your skin turned into flakes


You: I need a place to sit


But as you kept walking, you could see no sight of a resting place... nor people.


You: Where is everyone?


There were loud barks at you.


Wolves can't possibly swim, can they?


Your legs become numb, and you spin around your torso like a tree-climbing lizard,


it's just dogs


Their noises were dramatized by the silence of this eerily silent town.


Looking at the coins in your palms,


you realized they were of no use


You: Maybe the town citizens believed in the werewolf rumors, too. Why else would they leave


this fantastical place?


You become hysterical with nobody to chat with, and the whole werewolf legend slowly sips


past your mind.


Initially forced to survive,


you barged into other residences and ate some loaves of bread,


then, you took some grape juice,


and today, you are smoking some ham


The thieving adrenaline has turned into boredom exploration.


You: Maybe it is time to head back


You: It's been many days, the wolves would have been gone away by now


_________________________________


Stealing a small merchant canoe, you unwittingly became a pirate.


Astoundingly, the wolves were still here


But they have turned into carcasses,


but their big white fur is still attached,


usually, hunters would sell that for a hefty coin bag,


whoever did it was desperate


or, wasn't human


The crazy wind was whipping against the reddening trees,


You: Should I move back?


A creepy voice called out your name from the bushes,


nobody should know your name around here,


all of your home villagers should be hanging out at the hidden dungeon


Your curiosity was piqued, and you stepped closer and closer.


A black arm shoved in front of your face from the bushes.


You can't make out what you are seeing until it starts talking.


Ash: Do not return home


Holy, your friend has been massacred by a wild pack of animals,


You don't even dare to bring him back home, afraid of splitting his injured body apart.


You (Anger): What happened? Who did this to you?


Ash: The legend is true. And now the werewolves know our secret hideout.


Ash used the nearby scythe and ended his life.


Afraid of your life, you took the scythe and shouldered on.


_________________________________


As you walked back to your tiny canoe,


you started thinking about all the possibilities that have gone wrong,


your footsteps led the werewolves into the secret house


You: Unlikely, because I am skinny and leave almost no footprints


Your smell lingered in the air, and then the werewolves traced it.


You: No, because I am heading in the opposite direction


the hot September plus the no shower plus crowding with many unwashed villagers has created


a stench for you,


that leads the demons back into your backyard


Sniffing your sleeves,


You: Possible


Tightening your scythe, you know you cannot abandon your people.


No matter what had happened


Jogging in the darkness with the canopy's shroud,


you stopped hesitating and prowled your way back home


Hiding behind a giant trunk,


images of werewolves twice as tall as you,


were damaging the villages,


they were enraged,


that is good because it means they have not found the secret basement yet


Four red eyes hiding inside bushes tracking this lone scythe-wielder


...


_________________________________


A dense fog started crawling on four sides of the forest,


taking the opportunity, you headed back into safety.


Banging onto the metallic door, the door finally swung open,


you and two more lost villagers followed you into the hut,


one elderly required you to explain your bloody scythe,


and when you explained about the werewolf attack, his eyes became bigger


Elderly Ion: Lock the gate, and do not let anyone in anymore


Children: What's happening


Elderly Ion: The werewolves are here


At night, the sanctuary turned into a crime scene,


some villagers have gone missing,


they have banned torches and lamps for it would make the hut visible to the enemies,


but in this darkness,


they can't tell if the enemies have infiltrated the yard


You walked with the volunteer "guards" to surveil any threats,


but everyone looked dirty with some blood


You: This isn't working, but there were two that came into the hut with me on the last entry


Guards (Pointing finger): Is it them?


Realizing the guards and scythe-wielder are heading in their direction,


the tall humans sprung into werewolves,


their muscles trembling with nervousness


_________________________________


RUFF RUFF !!


RUFF RUFF !!


The loud sounds traveled past the doors.


You penetrated your scythe into one of them, and the organs spilled out.


The other guards held onto the other werewolf, and a knife was stabbed into its abdomen.


It was no longer a safe house,


everyone went mad and opened the doors,


watery mist and lost villagers were jumping beans


You couldn't find your nanny in this dark place or the foggy outside,


you are left with no choice except for self-preservation


But your legs are frozen with fear of what is going to happen to your poor old nanny then,


your mind has taken over control of your unwilling body


You: If I have to die, let it be worth


With a last, shivering breath, you screamed like a night hawk.


The sound vibrations pierced through the eardrums of the merciless beasts,


they let go of their bounty and went straight for your head


Even in the foggy mist, you can feel footsteps closing towards you.


Spinning like a Beyblade, your scythe was able to slice through some foes,


but the shadows in the mist became more and more


_________________________________


The day broke, and the mist barrier was disappearing.


Finally, standing face to face the nightmarish faces,


Zip Zip Zip


Zip Zip Zip


The sound of metal arrows was launched,


The werewolves flinched backward with their hairy chests full of stabs.


You quickly squatted down into the descending mist and headed toward the yellow fields,


All by yourself


Quiet as a cricket


Step by step, you continued marching further away.


When you looked upwards,


a shiny sword pointed toward your throat,


you smiled gracefully at the holy knight


The men smiled and knew you were not a shapeshifting werewolf,


otherwise, you would not be smiling


Then you frowned


You: My nanny!


The knight heaved his horse and rode back into the battle zone, unassumingly to find your


nanny.


When you continued to explore the yellow maze,


you found your granny


Cut cut cut cut cut


Cut cut cut cut cut


You: Nanny?


Nanny with her six-packs


Nanny and her long poking ears,


Nanny and her large mouth and protruding jaws,


Granny: What?


Together, you continued to help Granny clear the weeds.

Inside the hidden dungeon,


The guards managed to slew a few werewolves,


but the guards were kids, after all,


when the mightiest werewolves stepped into the corona,


they were quickly fallen,


the tall and ancient werewolf grabbed the best-dressed guard up into the air,


unable to move


"Ancient One": Do you want to be a werewolf?


It spoke like a wolf trying to speak the human language.


The end
