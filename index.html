<summary>Sword of the werewolf - Battling with the nemesis</summary>

Scratching the yellow weed, the boy finds a strangled blade

Me: I found a sword, I found a sword!
Granny: Good tidings
Granny peeks at the shiny find
Granny: That is a small sword
Penelope: Hahaha, that is a dagger, you mean
I swinged at the luminous sun, showing off my deadly armament

I did realise it was smaller than the ones from townsfolk, but to a kid like me, it was half my height

Taking out an useless ore from her pockets, the nice granny says: You will need to sharpen it if you want it to be a sword

I have no idea about the proper way of sharpening it, but I dashed with granny’s ore to a sheltered hut and slowly wisen up the sword

Penelope: Leaving us to do the work
Granny: We are in no hurry, you can continue tomorrow

Seeing granny’s sweat dripping from ears to shoulders, it is hard to leave her alone with the endless farm work

The long rows of yellow grains are getting mowed in clean straight rows, there are many workers here, but they have only cleared less than 1% of the fields

A loud thud

Granny: Blak, come and help

I (Blak) immediately rushed forwards to lend my assistance, I threw the yellow plunder onto the wooden carriages one by one

Penelope just stood there and watched, she is a girl, a skinny one

Elder Omo: The sun is screeching hot during the septembers, but it is when it is time for harvest, we need to hurry and build up our stronghold

Granny, Penelope and me was pulling a rope over our shoulders, dragging our wheat carriage into the village

The traders were here too, they were eyeing our catch, but since they did not approach us, we continued our work

There are two harvests a year, february and september, on february, we just leave our food supplies in the village center, but on september, we drive through a long and terrible pathway into the heart of the deep forest, nobody knows this entrance, except for the locals, or perhaps, nobody else wishes to walk for 4 kilometers long

In this secretive mound, there are hundreds of peasants, consisting of tailors, farmers and chicken breeders

Gong: Here ya go, thought you guys never make it

It was not even close to night, but the tall trees make this area dark, so one can lose perception of time

Granny pushed the wagon and the wheat flow out like an endless stream

A few workers came in with their hoes and straws, quickly churning them into straw beds and wheat rolls, the dried ones are straw beds, the fresh ones are wheat rolls

Gong was investigative and kept questioning about the dagger at my waist

Me: This is mine! I found it
Gong: You are no knight, you took it from someone else
Me: I found it on the middleway of the wheat fields

Gong is starting to get jealous, it seems like he is losing his chances of “sharing the dagger”

Granny drops off her wheat scythe on the toolbar, after a few seconds, Gong borrowed it, 2.5 times of my height, the scythe looks far more fearsome than my “sword”

Gong: Who is the bigger one?
Me: Oh shucks, yours is bigger

I know I have to say what he wants to hear, otherwise he will come after my sword

Gong happily spins the scythe above his head

Guard Soi: Please dun, you are going to hurt someone

Although there are guards in our peasant village, they only have small daggers and no metal shirts, they are still well-loved as they have a sense of justice

A month goes by quickly, the mound hidden village getting more and more populated, I wouldn’t be surprised if there are 1000 villagers in it, it is so hot and dampy in a housing area of 50 meters

Cluck, cluck, cluck

The chickens fly by granny and me

Me: Granny, I can’t stay here anymore, I am visiting town area

Granny: Have you heard of the werewolves?
Penelope: I want to listen, I want to listen
I nods: I dun believe in them, it just feels scaring kids into the hidden village to avoid the harsh incoming winter
Granny: The tale is true
Penelope: And the wolf is true

Gong: Need a hand?
Just the most annoying person to disrupt my campaign
Me: I am going to the riveria town
Gong proudly hangs the scythe on his back: Guess who is coming too?

Granny: How much coins do you need?
I took a bag of coins, it was more heavy than expected, I guess Granny isn’t expecting me to return until after winter

Gong: We could have a nice shower, an inn and a warm heated porridge
Me: This is just for emergency use

But yea, Gong was mostly right, the place we are living now is a sweltering nightmare, it wasn’t even this populated four years back then, we want a better accommodation

People started disappearing during winters and they realized it was unsafe at the main village, then they all crowded in this mystical village, where nobody goes missing

When my tough grandma is asleep, I bade her wrinkled face good bye, and when I crawl through low ceiling dungeon in the dark, the door opened by itself

Gong: I am ready
Self thinking: Dang, wanted to avoid him, now my coins are halved
Gong: I have always wanted to explore a real town, not in books, not in words, but on my real foot
Self thinking: Is he going to keep talking throughout the whole journey?

And Gong sure did, until the grass fields smells like dung, and the beckoning growls creeping closer and closer to our inner eardrums

I looked at Gong’s scythe, sure he did brought it, then I brought out my sword from my pocket, its blade shimmered in the dark forest

As we got out of the woods, it became apparent that we are being tracked by beasts coming in all directions
My leg jumped at a creepy feel, a brush of some sort of fur

There were silent grrs, we need to walk out of the tall grass as soon as possible

When we finally reached the river bank, the wolves and us came out of the wall of grasses

19 wolves versus 2 humans, not a good situation

The wolves were hiding their jaws, which just make their mouths buldging like hidden knives

Me: Should have listened to granny, wolves are as dangerous as werewolves, and, they are real

Gong on the other hand is hyped up, he started swinging his gigantic scythe like some kungfu master, the wolves weren’t scared, they just surrounded the two in a circle, ready to bite in any undefended perimeter

I went into a trance, the wolves kept barking in a slow motion manner, I could see beautiful cities on the other side of the river, they are calling me to come over

Tall white mansions curtained with grapevines, the bottom balcony like a wall painting

The trance entered into real motion as Gong started swiping at the hungry wolves

I went ahead and jumped into the blue river without a thought

Gong: What the..

Gong wanted to show off more of his skills, and perhaps hit a few, but now, he is alone, he started to panic and jumped into the blue river too

Splash!

I just realized I couldn’t swim, I was slowly dragged away by the river, until Gong started to pull my oversized shirt

Gong: Grab onto me!
Gong was half breathing and half drinking the river water, although a swimmer, it was the first time he swims at a moving river

I kept dragging on Gong’s black shirt like an eel, Gong hurriedly speed up his swimming pace, which isn’t working as I was pulling him towards the river flow

A giant protruding rock bumped onto me, I grab hold on it with another hand on Gong, now Gong can start to swim properly, I continued walling myself with any tall rocks I could step on, stopping myself from being blown by the growling river

We made it, we didn’t drown

But, boy or boy, Gong was furious, he started pulling my shirt on land

Gong: Look son, if you are going to put me in danger, we are going to split ways
Me: Sounds good to me, I sprayed water from my lungs onto the dirt ground
Gong: Why did you jump, when you can’t even swim?
Me: Cause I dun want to get eaten?

My muscles were sore, and I couldn’t argue with Gong anymore, I just went into a trance, and started watching Gong kept on complaining in slow motion

I tried to find my sword and it was still there, I returned back from my trance

Me: Is this a dream?
Gong: Looks better than my dream, to be honest, everything looks like it was built yesterday, clean and neat

We scrolled through the yellow marble streets, touched the walls with exotic paint, amazed at the multi-leveled red brick mansions

I have always heard of ship merchants telling how their town looks like when they visited our small village huts, and it looked exactly as they described

We lay down our wet clothes and let it dry like a bunch of goons, but really, there were nobody to judge us, the streets were literally empty
My skin starts to turn into flakes, when I crack up the dried flakes, it revealed my pink bruise underneath, feels like I shouldn’t

Gong was licking his dried skin, I stared at him like I was judging an idiot

Me: Let’s find a place to sit
Gong wore his shirt: I dun see anyone
I was frustrated: We dun need to find someone to be able to sit

But as we kept walking, there really was no people in sight, can we just sit at someone’s unattended house or shop? We tried to crawl into the gates of someone’s mansion, both enticed by the chance of nobody appearing and half expecting someone to show up and explain the phenomenon of this lonesome town

There were loud barks

No way, could it be the wolves? I have heard wolves can swim if the pool isn’t too deep

My legs stood like a tree and I bend my vision until I see the incoming army

Three fat dogs quickly came, but they didn’t bite, they just show their tongues and wag their tails

The barking sound felt so loud because the town was just so quiet

I was grabbing my bag of coins without realizing it and realized I couldn’t use them in this deserted town

We followed the dogs into the mansion living room, we enjoy the comfy chairs and rosy lit lamps

Gong started to interact more with the dogs and the dogs were in turn excited

I searched the sinister mansion without lights, and found bones and meat, I took them all out and gave the hounds and ourselves a feast

The night falls on our head, and we realized nobody is coming home, more and more questions started to cram my thoughts, I couldn’t sleep, I didn’t want to, I want to figure out why... this town is abandoned

Gong was hugging the dogs, sleeping together on the big pillow

Trying to take a break from my maze of thoughts, I walked outside the windows, expecting a clue or two, but nothing, nobody, no lights, no trees, just walls and nice residences

Days passed, we explored the town
Days passed, we got drunk
Days passed, the dogs started to follow us everywhere
Days passed, we found some tasty ham
Days passed, days passed

Me: Maybe we should return to our village
Gong: Are you being serious? Winter is already here, we can’t brave the journey with guts alone

Just as he spoke, white flakes started to zig zag downwards to our hair

Me: If the townspeople returned, we would be branded as thieves, what we had took and ate, this bag of coins won’t save us

Gong: Are you delusional? What people?

Indeed, the streets is so silent, you can’t even hear footsteps

Gong was fighting with a dog over a bone

I saw and pointed at the new merchant canoe: That wasn’t here previously

We headed there to sastify our curiousity, we then saw a dead body

Gong: Oh shucks! Pirates, we have to leave

I looked closer, but it just didn’t felt like a stab wound, his whole body were slashed with something big, like a scythe

Me: Where’s your scythe?
Gong looked at me sillily: The scythe is at the other side of river, I can’t possibly swim and carry it at the same time
Me thinking: Whatever it is, it is better if we return to our secret mound hut

Gong dragged the corpse out of the canoe and started paddling, I looked at the distant dogs bewildered at our departure

When we landed back at our land, we carried the canoe over our shoulders and put it on land, afraid of the river swallowing it

Clear snow carpeted the grassfields and tree canopies, we passed by a few snow boulders and found they were wolves corpses, could they been hungered to death? Or were they simply hibernating?

Gong kept shaking at the wolves, but they showed no response whatsoever

The sucking wind was pulling the barren trees, the sound whipped like a lashing over and over again

“Help”

“Help”

Can’t tell was it the wind making noise, or was someone asking for help

Gong got spooked, he pointed me to come over, there was someone inside the snow covered bush

A bleeding arm caught us by surprise
Injured man: Blak? Gong?

It took us some eye concentration before we realise we are talking to Ase, he always wanted to be a guard, what is he doing here?

Ase: You cannot return to village
I slowly whispered: Why?
Ase: There are werewolves
Usually we would laugh at this point, but Ase’s body were slashed like the previous victim in the boat, werewolf or pirate, this would be a dangerous enemy

Gong became angry: What actually happened? We are going to bring you back to the village for help

Ase: The legend is true and now we shall hide

We got shocked by his next action, he used a familiar looking scythe and ended his remaining life

Me: It is your scythe
Gong: What just happened?
Me: He was already half a dead man
Me: Whatever killed him wasn’t after food

Gong took the black bloodied scythe and went back to the canoe

The ghastly blood dripped from the scythe’s tip, but my mind was occupied with other thoughts, how did the werewolves found our rural village?

Could our footprints led the enemy to our doorstep? But we walked on tall grasses, and the snow would have covered any tracks

Could our dirty stench from no showering at the hidden mound create a path of trace? But the forest had always smelled

Gong: Are you coming on board or not?

I sniffed on my sleeves, wielding my sword: We need to warn the villagers

Gong: Guess not

Gong rowed away like a cold hearted bitch

Tightening my grip on the sword, I gain resolute in my action, if the demons would find the village, they would slay, and if the demons find the secret mound, they would annihilate

I walked like a brave man in the snow, the sun lingered onto my head as no leaves in the winter block the rays

Not long, I see tall aliens roaming the empty village, they moved like squids and had helmet of furs, their eyes were rage, and they prowl everywhere, the werewolves, as the legend said

The tall werewolves howl like angry mobs, they couldn’t find meat or victims, they bashed their heads onto the doors and windows

I slowly walked backwards, I am no match for 10 or more of these elites, three times my height, claws longer than my hand

I circled a longer route towards the hidden mound, at here is the fairy lake, the dense fog reduces visibility, I could walk freely without being followed

Six red eyes glowed in the distance, they could sniff me

I started running

I have no idea where I am running towards in the mist

When I stopped, I was already at the secret mound

I am a fool, I could have lead the evil straight into our secret hideout

But no matter how much I banged on the wooden door, it wouldn’t opened, finally a pinhole flips out and an eye sees me, next, the door swung open

Elder Omo: Next time you are this late, I wouldn’t open the door for you

I nodded but he didn’t let me pass

Elder Omo: Where is Gong?
Me: He stayed at riveria city
Elder Omo shoved me backwards and locked the door, opened the pinhole and said: You can’t enter until you bring him back

I spoke in my mind: Bastard

Gong seems like one without parents, but he did have, until they disappeared, just like those werewolves killing humans rumours

This is why, Gong keeps hanging around me

Now that I thought about it, I realized Gong could still be finding his parents, that is why he did not return, it was not fear but fearlessness

The secret mound is like a big sign of inviting unwanted attention, thus, I moved away, to the lotus swamp, hoping the stench would cover my presence

Although there were no red eyed visitors, every night, there are ruckus and shouting from inside the earthly mound

&lt; Inside the mound &gt;

It was dark and only one had a lamp, a matchstick flicked, and there were silent horror

Children bodies are laid on the floor, their blood leaving their body, sipping into the earthly ground

Guard Soi: What is happening?
Elder Omo looked dizzy: I am afraid the werewolves are within the compound

They were smart enough to ban torches and lamps, so the mound stayed hidden, but not realizing, this leads to crime or enemies hiding in the dark, doing whatever they wishes to do

Elder Omo and three guards including Soi made everyone stood in rows, their hands on each other shoulders, ensuring nobody skips their body check

At the tenth check, Elder Omo was surprised at the amound of fur one had

Villager: Just long hair sir
Elder Omo: We dun call people sir here

Immediately the guards pinned the suspect down on the ground, the furry suspect started to break his knees and arms, they became extended and claws started to protrude out

With long fangs and red eyes staring at Elder Omo, the werewolf said: Ruff! Ruff!

Trembling with nervousness, the guards started to stab the unholy werewolf, it looked like in a fish market where fishes gets gutted and chopped

Elder Omo: Kill him

Elder Omo with his bad sight realized he was late in sending commands, the werewolf was already slain

The organs, heart and intestines spilled out of the werewolf just like any humans would, the similarity of body structure with humans makes the viewers uncomfortable

There were shouting in the shadowy back: Someone ran! I put my hand on his shoulders but he left!

Everyone started panicking, it was a mental asylum, the guards have no more control of the crowd, nobody could see and organize the scene

Bam! Bam! Bam!

Finally, someone opened the locked door

The settlers went out of the round mound so that they could see, and feel safe

I kept watching and watching, waiting for my granny

The mist becomes watery and the villagers are like jumping beans, nobody knew what to do

This is when you realized, the werewolves have been ambushing outside the compound all along, they were lying flat underneath the thorny bushes, they started to jump out and clawed the residents

This area is no longer the safe house we knew, people are running in different directions, hoping to get lucky, hoping the other people in other directions gets unlucky instead

I can’t just leave at the shuttering nightmare, my granny will not be able to make it

There she is, I yelled: Granny!

Granny walked towards my shouting like a tortoise, I then dragged her faster, towards the lotus swamp, hoping the werewolves can’t swim

Granny and I managed to find refuge at lotus swamp but seeing all the residents getting slayed one by one brings the chill out of me, I can’t just swim here and hide underneath this chaotic madness

I walked out of the swamp, and swung my sword, flipping the dirt away

A werewolf came towards me, this is when I realized it is three times taller than me, my legs started to freeze like ice cubes, I could at least swing my sword but my attack range was so short I could almost hear the werewolf laugh

Guard Soi from a far distance was in damaged state, but he is still standing, it meant he had killed a werewolf in combat

With a last, shivering breath, Guard Soi screamed like a night hawk, all the demons’ attention turned towards him, and they ran towards him including the werewolf that was going to kill me

All I could see was large black shadows hopping and flying at Guard Soi, he was torn into shreds, you can’t even see a body part from him anymore

This is when I realized my stupidity and arrogance, I shouldn’t fight, I went running back to the lotus swamp, I returned to the center of smelly swamp to reunite with granny

The foggy mist crawled like a surfing wave, it felt like it was helping to conceal our presence but the water waves tells a different story

Granny: Something is heading towards us, something big

I took out my sword and spun it like a spinning top, slashing clouds and water vapours

Granny suddenly got pulled downwards the swamp, something got her

I dived in and saw the swimming werewolf, never would have expected werewolves to be able to swim, but this was indeed not a deep pool

I kept carving wounds into the werewolf while the beast attack movements seems slowed due to their gigantic size against the swamp water friction

I swam towards the nightmarish face and stabbed his neck, the werewolf stopped moving and floating upwards

Granny started to pull me upwards, afraid I couldn’t breathe

Metal arrows were shooting everywhere, some humans even got stabbed by the blind projectiles

But many of the iron arrows found their heads into the chests of giant werewolves

We are clueless, this is a rural village, there are no army here or bow-wielding peasants, unless they came from beyond the territory

And indeed, we see unfamiliar red armoured bowman hiding behind trees, shooting at the vile demons in a graceful, practiced manner

Because they are not from our territory, we would not know if they are bandits or territory invaders, our best option is to swim north

Because it was a short swamp, we got out and started running

Even up and down the slopes of hilly forest, white knights managed to cornered us

Granny: Mercy!

I looked at Granny and then at the knights’ covered faces, not knowing what to do

A knight: We need to kill you, you could be a werewolf
Granny: We aren’t werewolves

It was a stupid conversation I thought

A knight: Werewolves can shapeshift, dun you know?
Granny: Mercy!

It turned out that my granny was the smarter one, if I had dared to draw my sword, my head would have fell off, I was no match for 10 horseback armoured knights

They tied us with thick ropes against the thick tree trunks

Me: Granny?
Granny was so quiet, I could hear the crickets sing
Me: Granny?

The knights were already far off, and suddenly granny appeared in front of me, when she was supposed to be tied up in another tree

Granny with her six packs
Granny with her long poking ears

Granny with her large mouth and protruding jaws

She immediately snipped apart the ropes bounding me, her hands was swollen red, and she just seems abnormally large, how did she even break out of her ropes?

An iron arrow flew like a hornet towards my granny’s chest entering from her back, granny’s mouth spit blood onto my face

She begin to transform, turning more and more red-face, angry, and bigger, her fur almost covering her wounds and her disheveled face

Then a horseback knight came from behind her back and swooped off her neck, granny was no more

I looked upwards, waiting for my doom, a shiny blade landed on my neck, scratching me uncomfortably

I breathed deeply, maybe this is a good place to rest, the tall pine trees felt so serene

Knight: Get up, you fool!

I then had to run with the 10 horseback knights towards our secret mound

&lt; Inside the mound &gt;

The guards managed to slay a few werewolves, however, the werewolves outside were barraged by the red armoured bowmans, so they all went inside the secret mound

The guards were outnumbered 10 to 100 werewolves, they came in and dined the residents like pancakes with strawberry syrup

At the center of corona, the tallest and biggest werewolf appeared and make a speech, surprisingly, apparently, some werewolves are able to speak like humans

Ancient one: You can join us, or you could die
Residents: How do we join you? We are not werewolves

The ancient one smiled with a big dark mouth: Taste my blood, this is all it takes to become one

The residents went straight to pledge their loyalty to the canine pack, unknowingly became cursed to become a werewolf, however, currently, their transformation are still too weak to be of any practical use

The red armoured bowmen bowed at the incoming 10 horseback knights, and pointed at the secret dome, I was dragged inside the battlefield shelter too

The knights had to leave their horses outside as the ceiling was too low, they raised their lanterns and see all are human civilians, dead and alive ones

Knight: I know some of you are werewolves, so we will be tying up everyone here until we are safe

The 100+ humans’ veins buldged like serpents, they immediately turned into werewolves and swarming the fully armoured knights

I was so scared that I used my tiny sword and scratch as many transforming werewolves as I can, interesting, the werewolves stopped transforming

A gigantic dark beast bashed me to the walls

When I sat up, I couldn’t see my sword

Ancient one: Where did you get this sword?
Me: Give me back my sword
Ancient one: It have the power to undo the curse of becoming werewolves
Me: Give me back my sword
Ancient one: But it is broken, you lost the top half of it, its blessing powers got damaged, and now, it can kill werewolves with a scratch

The werewolves hearing these starting to fall onto their knees and stopped breathing

The knights kept on fighting with the horde of werewolves while the evil lord walked meancingly towards me, he dragged me up in the air: Where is the other half?

Me: I dun have the other half
Ancient one: I want to break my curse!

Fearing for the knights safety after so long has passed, the red armoured bowmen entered the compound, unfortunately, it just looked like a scarlet graveyard, the knights had fallen

Iron arrows started piercing through the skulls and arms of the werewolves and untransformed werewolves (humans)

The ancient one started rolling like a cannonball, squashing the armoured army like swiss cheese

It was no doubt, that the ancient one is the real combatant here, the other 100+ werewolves here are merely his cursed servants, being used as sacrificial shields in battle

I got dragged across the shaved yellow fields, now turning into dirty weeds and melting snow

It was a weird scene, 100+ werewolves and one human hanging out in the fields

Me: Here, here

The werewolves started to dig around the spot I pointed, and indeed, the other half of the sword was found

One month later, everyone was uncursed, half lived at the fields, the other half at riveria city, the secret buried

<summary>Running ball - Mixed gender basketball</summary>

The dark night sets in like a cloak

But yet, dribbling sounds could still be heard

In a rural place, there still lies residences

And boy, were they mad

But nobody is going to wake up at 3 am,

to challenge the boys

Ken spin his body and pass through the defender

The opponents were already breathing heavily

But Ken still kept in pace

Nevertheless, he couldn&#39;t barged through the well-guarded perimeter

He did a leap of faith

And the ball slipped pass his fingertips

That sensation

He already knew he scored

Swish

<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>_</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>

The furious eagle-eyed woman ready to complain

Unwittingly became a supportive audience

As the basketball players moved out of court

Some of them high-five the lady

Me: How the heck can they play basketball so well in the dark?

Me: They were moving so fast, I could only see shadows

My eyes side-tracked to the tall Ken

In white jersey with red stripes, short and light shorts

He walked faster than anyone

I wanted to watch more

Then I realized, there is work tomorrow

Lowering the curtain with butterfly motifs,

it helps to block out the sound

The neighbors were just pleased they are finally heading back home

This area have integrated houses, everyone&#39;s houses are connected together

It saves about 50% of building costs

But when the athletes heads back home,

you could slightly hear their noises entering in the house,

makes it hard to sleep

<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>_</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>

It&#39;s community day

Everyone is gathering to give out free food

Forking the bread rolls and chomping on the sweet fried foods

There were more than you could count

It tuns out this place is a low-income street

Most of the residents usually hid at home to reduce living expenses

I handover a $50 note into the donation box,

its not just the poor, there are pregnant people in here

I am worried for them

Bulls: Thanks for your generosity!

I got spooked

The box attendant seems to return from his restroom break

Me: Aren&#39;t you a familiar face?

Bulls: We high-five

Me: Oh yeah, the basketball players... at night

Bulls: Aren&#39;t you coming to play with us?

Me: I can&#39;t see at night and it might be...

Bulls: Lol, we dun always play at night

Bulls: But sometimes, you know, all the work schedules and real life stuffs pushing our playtime backwards

I wanted to complain but I do not want to disappoint his smiling face

Me: Maybe next time

Bulls: A deal then!

I was kinda rejecting him, but he couldn&#39;t comprehend it

I have never played sports in my entire life

During school sports classes, the students that were in sports clubs hoarded all the sport equipment, and they were mostly boys

The girls...just run, then walk around

Eventually, we just sit in the school cafe and take a break

Where was the sports teacher even?

<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>_</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>

I went back inside my dilapidated house

Me (Complaining): Why are they performing event so near my house?

Looking at the ceiling

Looking at the fridge

Looking at the mirror

I got bored, and looked through the windows

Once again, I saw the handsome man

This time round, he was wearing a suit, a far cry from his sweaty jersey style

I already knew his name was Ken

Whenever they want to pass the ball, they shout each other names

A serious athlete would be showing secret finger signs

And then I remembered, they can&#39;t see well at night

But Ken wasn&#39;t socializing in the party,

he was...

digging into the food

and not handing in any donations or second-hand supplies

Can&#39;t if he is broke or rich, his suit could be given to him

The curiosity kills the cat

<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>_</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>

I have a great job, I work with accounting

when there is no work, I stay at home

But recently, it gets boring at home

So I traveled around

It seems like there were many sport activities going on here

Basketball, badminton, golf, tennis, soccer, volleyball, and even more

One might find an olympian here

Street 52

If I crossed further, it will be a shopping district

I am rich but I am picky in what I spend my money on

&quot;Hey hey!&quot;

I turned around

Bulls: You came!

Bulls: Just in time, we are missing one player

Me: Oh no, I am traveling around

Bulls: Good, you are in light clothing

Bulls: I seen you always wear those checker uniforms, can&#39;t play sports in those

Before realizing it,

the ball was in my hands,

my shoulders squeezed with anxiety

Pop

Did I just?

The audience cheered, seemingly at me

Basketball wasn&#39;t as hard as I imagined

<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>_</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>

In just a few weeks, I caught the sports fever

Jersey, branded sneakers and protective glasses

I looked like a clown

Better than a moldy cheese hiding at home

I got into a few mixed gender competitions

Bulls were coaching me like no tomorrow

I kept complaining why can&#39;t I join the woman only competitions?

Jay: Our street is shrinking, that&#39;s why

Bulls (Disapprove): It haven&#39;t happened yet

Jay: The government is expanding the shopping district, street 70 will swallow half of street 52

Bulls: Only if the residents sell their houses to the government

Me: The residents looks needy

Jay: That&#39;s why this street have been targeted

When the sun sets, so does my ambition

If I were in a woman only competition,

I could guarantee a win 75% of the time,

challenging the boys, I am losing 100% of the time,

battling against mixed gender, its fifty fifty, depending on my teammates,

I dun want to play a sports where I keep losing

My house were beaming lights,

it means someone was here

<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>_</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>

An agent appeared before I slot in the house key

Agent: Madam, you are really lucky

Agent: I have a great offer of buying your house for $500,000

Me: Holy nuts!

I bought this cheap gallow for $90,000 and the house improvement costs $10,000

When bathing

I kept thinking

and thinking

Money or basketball

Community or retirement

Next morning, I walked out

Neighbors were whispering

Dogs were barking

The basketball courts were empty

Where is everyone?

Then, I saw Ken sitting on a chair, hugging his basketball like a baby

Me: Care for a fight?

Ken: You mean like basketball right?

Me: Ah, yea, my mistake

I did a jump shot and he did jumping block

I was shorter than him and released my ball faster than he expected

Clank

The ball swirl into the net

My clothes were on fire

I am as light as a lizard,

dodging all of his snatches and passing through him with ease

The sun bleeds through ken&#39;s forehead

This is when I saw his cold steel of nerves

He wasn&#39;t even slightly affected by his losses

It&#39;s three to zero, four more balls, and victory is mine

Ken mumbled something underneath his breath

1, 2, 3

1, 2, 3

I feinted a shot but moved in and did a lay-out,

but my ball was missing

Ken stole the ball away, he needs to clear the court,

which means he have to move out of three point line and return back to make a shot

But he didn&#39;t returned

He stood outside of the 3 point line and make a long distance shot

Swish

It doesn&#39;t matters, it still counts as 1 point in half-court matches

Three point to one point, I am still leading

But every time I flick a shot or dribble past him,

Ken swiped away the ball with uncanny speed

He have completely read through my movements

It&#39;s three to five points now, my motivation sunk like an anchor

He passed the ball like a slow dart towards me as it was my turn

Time to change the tempo, I make a daring shot

A three-pointer

The small wind changed the ball trajectory slightly, and I missed

Ken blazed in to get the rebound

As I tried to snatch his ball from behind, he spin around and did a jump shot,

too fast, less than a second, the ball crossed through the net, and my knees are grinding against the tough floor

Ken: Are you alright? Let&#39;s bring you to a clinic

My head was on fire

Me: After the match

3 to 6 points, one more point and I am losing

I dribbled in a triangular movement and Ken was with me every step of the way,

when I raised my ball, all I could see were one-hundred palms swaying in the air

This guy ain&#39;t going making it easy for me

When my shot was blocked, he quickly clear the court,

this time round, I followed suit and tried to snatch the ball,

like in anime, he jumped high on one foot towards the net,

then another jump using another leg,

his hands almost touching the ring

Swish

I lost 

completely

<summary>Beneath the forest canopy - School pranks</summary>

Rumors traveling like spiderwebs across the school corridors

Piano, disturbances and riddles...

One could not see apart the distinction of the false reality

They relied on the crowded mind power to differentiate an honesty

But tangled in the web of truths,

one will be eventually be caught in it,

when the truthsayer starts lying too

<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>_</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>

We were told the school had constructed a statue near the fountain,

but it looked so realistic, we felt like being pranked

Geese was the bold one, poking the statue with a twig

Surprisingly, the statue wouldn&#39;t barge

Me: Are you a statue?

There were no response, the eye pupil never flicked

Juma, the dumb one, run towards the statue and stopped inches before hitting the girl

But the statue remained motionless

Eventually we got bored and head for the bus stop

When the school bus came, we spin our head and got spooked

The fountain girl was standing right behind us

Her skin was porcelain white

Her posture was straight upright

And her facial expression was blank, just like a statue&#39;s

Throughout the bus ride, the other school girls were staining our reputation behind our backs

Immediately, we turned into perverts

And no girls dared to cross our paths

<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>_</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>

Cinder of sadness and soil of guilt buried into our footsteps, we started distancing from each other

Blink: Where is the girls&#39; restroom?
Me: That&#39;s a strange question for I am a guy
Blink: The girls&#39; restroom have been renovating for so long
Me: I heard they are adding a swimming pool in it

Blink walks away and discussed with Sphere
Sphere walks to Geese: Have you heard that they are making a swimming pool in the girls&#39; restroom?
Geese: Huh? Your restroom haven&#39;t completed yet? The boys restroom already have water slides in it already

Sphere walks away and discussed with Jenny
Jenny talks to her beside classmate (Juma): Do you have water slides in the boys&#39; restroom?
Juma: There is even watery playground and water catapults

Blink, Sphere and Jenny walks together to the renovating girls&#39; restroom: Maybe they forgot to take away the renovating sign

They peeked in but was disappointed, it was still half-renovating

The embarrassed male construction workers quickly move out

So the girls continued their business, when they left the restroom, they decided to check on the boys&#39; restrooms, just a diagonal peek without entering

They saw an ordinary restroom, and the incoming boys were laughing at them

&quot;Perverts&quot;

<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>_</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>

More and more students fell into the trap of fiction, people became unhappy and unwilling to trust each other anymore

The principal announced: No more lies, no more pranks, grow up and join a school club today

Blink: The school clubs are optional, we can go home now
Sphere: I should tell everyone then
Jenny: Does that means I dun have to setup table and sit there to recruit new members?

The school club event was mostly empty, everyone already went back home
The principal and the senior club members waiting to recruit members were disappointed

Discouraged, the principal started making school clubs optional

Everyday, after school, we just went back home and watch TV

Our lives became entwined with the shallow television shows

We are separated from each other, sinking into our home&#39;s sofa

Me: Mum, dad
Parents: Why are you back so early? Dun they have tuition or school clubs?
Me: I think many of the school clubs shut down already because of lack of participants
Parents: Dun worry about it, we will talk to them about it
Me: Can&#39;t you bring me out for shopping instead
Parents: We have to work, silly

Within a few months, the school have constructed a community garden, everyone started hanging out there for the fresh breath of air and chit chatting with mates

Blink: People should really know more about this zen garden
Me: It seems like a half effort of combining the nearby forest together by dismantling the school fence
Sphere: That makes it more natural, see all the wildlife and fresh air
Geese sipping on his sugary drink
Jenny playing with her tarot cards
Juma slogging a hoe on his back

Me: What are you doing?
Juma: Plotting a pathway, people hate stepping on the mud on rainy days

Eventually, we used those cheap gravels to plot the road, and bring abandoned school chairs and tables to the wild garden and make it into a more welcoming resort, students can eat or study here now

Every now and then, a lady would come over and teach about the forest animals and plants, she gave us pots to cultivate our own herbs and cages to house our caught wild pets

On senior year, the lady turns out to be a biology teacher and is in charge of the science club, she happily registered all of the participants as science club members even including our previous junior years and had wrote good remarks on our academic transcripts

<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>_</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>

Radio: Auntie was lost
Me: She seems to be heading towards the world war 2 cemetery
Radio: Nobody have visited there in years, and there is a cliff there
Me: Understood

I am 30 years old with muscular thighs, bringing a survival bag, I walked steadily along the forest grounds

The stick insect on the tree log stopped moving when it spotted me

The yellow-chest bird stopped chirping when it sensed me

The black salamander whipped into the river after hearing my boots trampling on crumpled leaves

Me: Auntie, you can&#39;t take the tree

The old auntie had dug out a bonsai tree near the cliff and carefully wrap it with a newspaper

Auntie: Mind your own business

I flipped open my identity purse

Green tree symbol circling a mountain diagram

Me: I am a park warden, this is kinda my business

The auntie gave up and returned back the bonsai tree

Auntie: But this tree looks so good

Me: It looks good because it is settled on a cliff, the wind blew against the branches and shaped it this way, the direct overhead sun spur a crown direction growth of its canopy leaves, once you bring it back to your home, it would starts to decay, even if you managed to save it with artificial lights and pesticides, it would start bending out of shape

Auntie: You are very knowledgeable

Me: Just trying to convince you madam, this cliff is made of soil not rocks, it would sink any time

Auntie nods her head and I brought her back to park entrance

Radio: She&#39;s safe? Dark is setting

Me: Yes, Juma, patrol concluded

<summary>Another story - The becoming of a knight</summary>

Stabbing the shovel into the soil, you grumbled for better wages

You basically dig up the whole of this paradise, planting fragrant roses and soft pine trees, the vines slithered up the logs, the bluejays and black jays partying at the tree top

You can name every single botanical plant in this concrete mansion, and it dampens your spirit whenever the mistress cuts off the &quot;dead plants&quot;, even though when the &quot;dead plants&quot; would be self-revitalizing during the next spring

Mistress in her curtain dress staring at you through the windows

Sweeping leaves is easy, having someone watched over your back is uncomfortable

The autumn has arrived with its scented gust of fragrance

It&#39;s the smell of tree sap and fruit pollen

Cradling the miniaturized trees and bundling them with beautifully carved wooden boxes, you made bonsai for the mistress to sell

Every time, the bonsai are sold, the mistress goes on a shopping spree, new clothes, new furniture and new workers, occasionally we get new knights, and today is such a day, for travelers afar and nearby have seek refuge in the wolf-head mansion

You had worked as a room maiden too, so you know how difficult it was to serve the visitors

You (satire): Oh, the bed is black and dirty, wouldn&#39;t you bring me new bed sheets?
You (satire): Ow, I am a vegan, dun you know?
You (satire): I need more tea, it must be hot, not cold
You (satire): Where is the restroom? Unless you want me to do it here?

<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>_</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>

What makes this garden unique are that there are rusty and shiny swords stabbed downwards into the soil bed, making it a circle of ritual

In the past, the becoming of a knight requires one to slay the opponent

Nobody came to retrieve the slain knight&#39;s sword, and so it was left here to rust

In recent times, the system got changed

Participants needed to pay in bag of coins

Winner take all coins

Therefore even if the mistress do not want to recruit a treacherous knight

He would still be paid in full, and leave with honor

At night, the soft glimmer of the new moon wakes up the rare flowers and you

When you paced up and down the yard for thieving squirrels and intruding beggars, you could see a field of abundance, rosy pillows, fluff of cloud petals, tipsy apple tulips

A boy alerted your vision

You (Stern): What is your house name?

Boy: I have none

You: Only those with houses can compete in tomorrow&#39;s knight selection

Boy: I can pay with the price of my life

You: That&#39;s the old system, nowadays, you have to pay a bag of coins

Boy: And would you spare me some?

You: Lol, are you mad, begone beggar

Boy: You have toiled long and hard in this prison for so long, how long more can you endure?

You: If I give you anything, I am getting nothing back

Boy: If I become a knight, I can buy your freedom

You: And work for you? Still the same, still the same

Boy: No, you would be released in full to repay tonight&#39;s debt

You snickered at the boy&#39;s height

The boy sighed and showed some martial arts movements, quick and precise strokes, however, it was fist-fighting and not sword wielding

Also, anyone can punch fast without the heavy armor weighing down on you

<strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>_</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>

Money, power and horses

Those three were the currency of this era

Becoming a knight will grant you all three

But the price could be your very life

There were 12 participants,

4 dead, 6 survived, 2 remaining,

5 chosen to be knights and serve the wolf-head clan

The last two were disqualified, one had no house and one had no coins

The disgruntled unchosen knight threw his two bag of coins onto the boy and the tall, slim man, then he lingered around as a spectator

The judge with grey beard, looking at the ferocious knight waiting for more entertainment dared not disrupt the scene, after all, he could just exclude the two combatants as knights anyway

You (Whisper): Now things are interesting, would the boy win?

The weak fellas robbed the slain knight of their equipment

The scarred knight snorted

Usually, the mistress would scold you over uncleared flowers

But today were carpet of blood and stiff bodies and she still kept silent like an owl

A few kids, supposedly princes and princesses were looking downwards to the battlefield from the high balcony, their mouths were agape with shock and terror as though it was their first time spectating

The courtyard is lined with granite walking paths, resembling a tortoise&#39;s outline, the inside were flowers, the outside were trees, the front were judges and mistress and from afar was the victorious knight and you

The two &quot;knights&quot; bowed to each other at the tortoise&#39;s center

A double upward swing of sword pushed the boy backwards, he kept moving backwards to absorb the weight of the metal

The tall and slim man smiled in relief, his body size has granted him a huge advantage, in physics and his range of attacks

The tall man continued his combo, he smashed through the boy&#39;s grayish armor in just a few seconds

You (Scorn): Glad, I didn&#39;t spent half my fortune on you

As the tall man restore his posture, the boy starts swinging his sword like trying to light up a matchstick, every single clash was blocked by the tall man&#39;s sword

The tall man strategically moved backwards, boasting the boy&#39;s confidence artificially, and just when the boy&#39;s loses his energy and concentration, the tall man spiked a lightning and tore through the boy&#39;s shoulders

The boy&#39;s armor slipped off, it was evident who is the winner

Boy: Caw caw!

That was the strangest battle shout the spectators have ever heard

The judge crossed his wrists, hinting the boy to give up

But the boy wouldn&#39;t

The tall man decided to end the match, by killing or kicking his opponent out of the ring

Clash clash clash clash!

The sword keeps battering the boy&#39;s blade

Every hit was like an earthquake, fear painted the boy&#39;s face

The boy pretended to back out of the ring but haven&#39;t

The man decided to have mercy and kick him out instead

Swoop

The boy managed to bleed the man&#39;s leg

The man was angry but couldn&#39;t walk straight

The boy circled around the man

The man&#39;s vision was blurred

Caw caw!

The man swiped towards the air where a distant raven was cawing

The boy slithered into melee position and stick his skinny blade up the man&#39;s torso

But the man was still alive

Like a zombie, he hacked onto the boy&#39;s neck

The boy walked backwards uninspiringly

out of the ring

He looked at both of his hands that touched his neck

Blood is all he could see

The man was also badly injured, he raised his sword and pummeled it down into the soil bed along with the rest of the garden swords

The happy knight stood out of his spectator zone and took back his two bag of coins and left like nobody&#39;s business

You went into the circle by mistress&#39; orders, bandaging the bleeding joints and giving them words of encouragement

The boy (Last breath): At least I have tried

The man didn&#39;t speak, he knelt down like a statue, when the blood didn&#39;t stopped escaping from his wound, his eyes turned white

You: You knights fought well, now rest

<summary>Rakuen Tsuiho / Expelled from Paradise</summary>
Anime movie
English novel (Yasugi Masayoshi)

Rephrased novel excerpt

Angela in her stylish uniform reported to her boss
Boss: That&#39;s unexpected
They discussed of an artificial intelligent being gone rogue and trying to flee the planet to study the black space and beyond

Boss: So where is this sentient being that you speak of?
Angela: Back in the real world
Boss: You have been literally tasked to capture the unidentified hacker that accessed our virtual world illegally, and you came back with nothing?
Angela: The Pioneer is a self-learning program, I had discussion with him and he understands that he shouldn&#39;t be hacking into our paradise

Neo: What?
Boss: You left a computer program capable of bringing total annihilation to our virtual world back in the real world, not bringing him back, not destroying, not handing him over to the other deva agents, what is your motive, girl?
Angela was very confused and realized she is on the end of the pirate ship plank, ready to be kicked into the sea soon

Angela: The pioneer is not a human, and bots have never harmed humans

Neo: We aren&#39;t humans, dun you get it yet?
Neo: We are software printed from deceased human brains
The simulator changes scenery and a giant with an elephant head intrudes the arena
Ganesha: If we let the rouge bot leave the surface of earth, he will return back one day and destroy everything we have ever owned

Angela&#39;s heartbeat pulsed into her throat: The pioneer is trying to explore the deepest reaches of the galaxy that we can&#39;t, when he returns back, he can provide us with endless data and calculations to make a bigger virtual world

Boss: You are risking our peace and prosperity for a chance at expanding our paradise system
Neo: You have dedicated your whole life to protect us and the system, and just today, the most important task of all, and you completely botched it, what else have you left to say?

Angela, although a virtual human, tried not to cry

Ganesha: Tell me the location of the sentient being, and we will arrange the other agents to complete the task at hand

In spite, Angela declined
Angela: The pioneer is just a hardware attached with a self-repeating software that imitates learning, a far cry from our paradise system, you guys should be ashamed of being scared of a little bot
Green digital ropes sprung from below and tied up Angela&#39;s body, arms and thighs, she tried to protest, but the ropes starts to bandage her mouth too
Neo: You are deprived of the citizenship of paradise, you will be digitalized into the archive

Inside the void, Angela could see nothing, hear nothing and touch nothing
There was nothing left ahead of her, only injust

<summary>The portal - UFOS coming down to stop medieval war</summary>
The four capsules burns invisible fire and slowly brings down the royal palace, the royal palace looks exactly like an UFO disk, but what is inside are not little grey beings, rather, they are long shadows without a body, they pass through the doorless spaceship with ease

A vision has appeared, there were intense battles nearby the teleporting radius, this might disrupt the electromagnetic barrier and sabotage the teleportation, the superior beings had no choice but to interfere, even though they wanted to end the war, they did not want to take sides

At Alessandre battlefield, the humans waged primitive wars against each other

&quot;Bring them down!&quot;

&quot;This was my great father&#39;s land, the great Alexander!&quot;

&quot;I have returned back to reclaim my land!&quot;

Once nomads, the Rhodians have seek refuge on this half desert half sea territory, it is now known as the sand city of Rhodes, they quickly stood their ground, opening their chests and throwing long spears at the arriving guests

Antifield the battlefield master was attacking via battleships, the incoming little lances could not delay the towering battleships, they setup their cannons and blasted the sandstone walls into bricks and crumbs

Antifield have awaited in the deep ocean for weeks just to rally the whole of his naval force, he have been taught to use all might against one enemy fortress station, this way, no matter how strong the wall, you will have a continuous supply of troops, firepower and ladders to breach the defenses

It was a majestic fight, the watery ships stormed into the broken castle with the seawater flooding the sandstone castle with quartz roofs

But once the ships arrived on land, it couldn&#39;t move like a stranded elephant, the naval troops became sitting ducks as well

Fire powder barrels was thrown onto the ship like grenades, fire torches was then thrown onto the gigantic ships, the ship burned like no tomorrow, for the ships were made of 100% wood, the naval troops looked across the ship fences, if they jumped, it would be 20 meters of air before slapping onto the desert floor, 80% death rate I would say, but staying on a burning ship, 100% death rate

And so, they jumped like lemmings

It was both a military setback and a financial disaster, Antifield with 800 gold coins of naval battleships and naval troops against a leaderless rhodian army with possibly 15 gold coins worth of spear weaponry and fire powder barrels

Antifield soon realized his blunder and blew the retreating horn, as the remaining naval force tried to retreat, the battleships keeps hitting the sea rocks, the waters are too shallow as the desert keeps drinking in the salty sea

&quot;Even god can&#39;t help us now&quot;, Antifield realized he is trapped

Three black shadows loomed through the sky and attracted some of the combatant&#39;s attention

&quot;Miss si ya du&quot;

&quot;Ghost ni siwa&quot;

&quot;Water gazer&quot;

&quot;Into the abyss&quot;

A big flash of blinding light passed through the entire zone

It was as though the day turned white

The sun disappeared

The clouds disappeared

The enemies disappeared

Joe biden, a rhodian fighter starts yelling, &quot;I can&#39;t see&quot;, and then he falls down the sandstone stairs

Pringles, a naval troop starts to walk aimlessly and suddenly dropped off the ship&#39;s side, and accidentally flew into the sea, splash!

But the battle still continued,

the blind soldiers fought each other until they realized they are killing their own units

One of the black shadow folds his arms (Disappointed): What are they doing?

After the intense battle, the blind took 330 days to recover their eyesight, and all of them speak legends of devilish beings participating in the battle, the naval troops that were captured have descended to slaves and they kept making breads everyday without fail

The rhodians starts to setup a council whom then requested for a hero to lead the fight against the aggressive Romans

And so the story of  ̶h̶e̶r̶c̶u̶l̶e̶s̶  donald trumpe begins

&quot;I will build the biggest wall the world have never seen&quot;

&quot;The wall will move and devour cities&quot;

&quot;The wall can jump through sea and sand&quot;

&quot;But most importantly,&quot;

&quot;The Romans will pay for it!&quot;

The crowd cheered like a parade as silly as the announcement was

But it was no joke, the council have actually found a device left by the shadow beings during the previous war, it can levitate mass hundred times of its own, its battery recharges based on natural free sunlight, all they now need is an army and a hero

The barrel of imitation wine slams the table, Antifield with a scarred face swears one day, he would take everything back, but as of right now, he is just a breadmaking slave, he would need to convince the army to bring him along, otherwise he would forever be stuck in this sandy pen

On the other side of the sea, the tanned merchant greets the king with a crown of leaves

Roman king: You said you have a plan?

Merchant: Indeed, I have 1000 baby oil bottles

Roman king: I dun understand

The merchant opens his hood, revealing a handsome face, another tactician brings in a vertical map board, the merchant points towards the map of casualties rises the closer the roman army travels from sea to land

Merchant: This is because fire cannons and battle troops are ineffective against the fire-quelling sand and seasoned desert warriors

Merchant: We could launch catapults of baby oil bottles into the enemy&#39;s fortress, unlike fire which would disappear on contact with sand, the baby oil will continue to exist and lubricate the sandy paths, the enemies will find it hard to move through the slippery battlefield, often, they will fall, since their shoes have much less grip than ours

Roman king: What should I do with you if you fail?

Merchant: I shall gladly give you my head

The roman king starts a celebration party to boost the troops&#39; morale and to announce the next war

The end
