Scratching the yellow weed, the boy finds a strangled blade

Me: I found a sword, I found a sword!
Granny: Good tidings
Granny peeks at the shiny find
Granny: That is a small sword
Penelope: Hahaha, that is a dagger, you mean
I swinged at the luminous sun, showing off my deadly armament

I did realise it was smaller than the ones from townsfolk, but to a kid like me, it was half my height

Taking out an useless ore from her pockets, the nice granny says: You will need to sharpen it if you want it to be a sword

I have no idea about the proper way of sharpening it, but I dashed with granny’s ore to a sheltered hut and slowly wisen up the sword

Penelope: Leaving us to do the work
Granny: We are in no hurry, you can continue tomorrow

Seeing granny’s sweat dripping from ears to shoulders, it is hard to leave her alone with the endless farm work

The long rows of yellow grains are getting mowed in clean straight rows, there are many workers here, but they have only cleared less than 1% of the fields

A loud thud

Granny: Blak, come and help

I (Blak) immediately rushed forwards to lend my assistance, I threw the yellow plunder onto the wooden carriages one by one

Penelope just stood there and watched, she is a girl, a skinny one

Elder Omo: The sun is screeching hot during the septembers, but it is when it is time for harvest, we need to hurry and build up our stronghold

Granny, Penelope and me was pulling a rope over our shoulders, dragging our wheat carriage into the village

The traders were here too, they were eyeing our catch, but since they did not approach us, we continued our work

There are two harvests a year, february and september, on february, we just leave our food supplies in the village center, but on september, we drive through a long and terrible pathway into the heart of the deep forest, nobody knows this entrance, except for the locals, or perhaps, nobody else wishes to walk for 4 kilometers long

In this secretive mound, there are hundreds of peasants, consisting of tailors, farmers and chicken breeders

Gong: Here ya go, thought you guys never make it

It was not even close to night, but the tall trees make this area dark, so one can lose perception of time

Granny pushed the wagon and the wheat flow out like an endless stream

A few workers came in with their hoes and straws, quickly churning them into straw beds and wheat rolls, the dried ones are straw beds, the fresh ones are wheat rolls

Gong was investigative and kept questioning about the dagger at my waist

Me: This is mine! I found it
Gong: You are no knight, you took it from someone else
Me: I found it on the middleway of the wheat fields

Gong is starting to get jealous, it seems like he is losing his chances of “sharing the dagger”

Granny drops off her wheat scythe on the toolbar, after a few seconds, Gong borrowed it, 2.5 times of my height, the scythe looks far more fearsome than my “sword”

Gong: Who is the bigger one?
Me: Oh shucks, yours is bigger

I know I have to say what he wants to hear, otherwise he will come after my sword

Gong happily spins the scythe above his head

Guard Soi: Please dun, you are going to hurt someone

Although there are guards in our peasant village, they only have small daggers and no metal shirts, they are still well-loved as they have a sense of justice

A month goes by quickly, the mound hidden village getting more and more populated, I wouldn’t be surprised if there are 1000 villagers in it, it is so hot and dampy in a housing area of 50 meters

Cluck, cluck, cluck

The chickens fly by granny and me

Me: Granny, I can’t stay here anymore, I am visiting town area

Granny: Have you heard of the werewolves?
Penelope: I want to listen, I want to listen
I nods: I dun believe in them, it just feels scaring kids into the hidden village to avoid the harsh incoming winter
Granny: The tale is true
Penelope: And the wolf is true

Gong: Need a hand?
Just the most annoying person to disrupt my campaign
Me: I am going to the riveria town
Gong proudly hangs the scythe on his back: Guess who is coming too?

Granny: How much coins do you need?
I took a bag of coins, it was more heavy than expected, I guess Granny isn’t expecting me to return until after winter

Gong: We could have a nice shower, an inn and a warm heated porridge
Me: This is just for emergency use

But yea, Gong was mostly right, the place we are living now is a sweltering nightmare, it wasn’t even this populated four years back then, we want a better accommodation

People started disappearing during winters and they realized it was unsafe at the main village, then they all crowded in this mystical village, where nobody goes missing

When my tough grandma is asleep, I bade her wrinkled face good bye, and when I crawl through low ceiling dungeon in the dark, the door opened by itself

Gong: I am ready
Self thinking: Dang, wanted to avoid him, now my coins are halved
Gong: I have always wanted to explore a real town, not in books, not in words, but on my real foot
Self thinking: Is he going to keep talking throughout the whole journey?

And Gong sure did, until the grass fields smells like dung, and the beckoning growls creeping closer and closer to our inner eardrums

I looked at Gong’s scythe, sure he did brought it, then I brought out my sword from my pocket, its blade shimmered in the dark forest

As we got out of the woods, it became apparent that we are being tracked by beasts coming in all directions
My leg jumped at a creepy feel, a brush of some sort of fur

There were silent grrs, we need to walk out of the tall grass as soon as possible

When we finally reached the river bank, the wolves and us came out of the wall of grasses

19 wolves versus 2 humans, not a good situation

The wolves were hiding their jaws, which just make their mouths buldging like hidden knives

Me: Should have listened to granny, wolves are as dangerous as werewolves, and, they are real

Gong on the other hand is hyped up, he started swinging his gigantic scythe like some kungfu master, the wolves weren’t scared, they just surrounded the two in a circle, ready to bite in any undefended perimeter

I went into a trance, the wolves kept barking in a slow motion manner, I could see beautiful cities on the other side of the river, they are calling me to come over

Tall white mansions curtained with grapevines, the bottom balcony like a wall painting

The trance entered into real motion as Gong started swiping at the hungry wolves

I went ahead and jumped into the blue river without a thought

Gong: What the..

Gong wanted to show off more of his skills, and perhaps hit a few, but now, he is alone, he started to panic and jumped into the blue river too

Splash!

I just realized I couldn’t swim, I was slowly dragged away by the river, until Gong started to pull my oversized shirt

Gong: Grab onto me!
Gong was half breathing and half drinking the river water, although a swimmer, it was the first time he swims at a moving river

I kept dragging on Gong’s black shirt like an eel, Gong hurriedly speed up his swimming pace, which isn’t working as I was pulling him towards the river flow

A giant protruding rock bumped onto me, I grab hold on it with another hand on Gong, now Gong can start to swim properly, I continued walling myself with any tall rocks I could step on, stopping myself from being blown by the growling river

We made it, we didn’t drown

But, boy or boy, Gong was furious, he started pulling my shirt on land

Gong: Look son, if you are going to put me in danger, we are going to split ways
Me: Sounds good to me, I sprayed water from my lungs onto the dirt ground
Gong: Why did you jump, when you can’t even swim?
Me: Cause I dun want to get eaten?

My muscles were sore, and I couldn’t argue with Gong anymore, I just went into a trance, and started watching Gong kept on complaining in slow motion

I tried to find my sword and it was still there, I returned back from my trance

Me: Is this a dream?
Gong: Looks better than my dream, to be honest, everything looks like it was built yesterday, clean and neat

We scrolled through the yellow marble streets, touched the walls with exotic paint, amazed at the multi-leveled red brick mansions

I have always heard of ship merchants telling how their town looks like when they visited our small village huts, and it looked exactly as they described

We lay down our wet clothes and let it dry like a bunch of goons, but really, there were nobody to judge us, the streets were literally empty
My skin starts to turn into flakes, when I crack up the dried flakes, it revealed my pink bruise underneath, feels like I shouldn’t

Gong was licking his dried skin, I stared at him like I was judging an idiot

Me: Let’s find a place to sit
Gong wore his shirt: I dun see anyone
I was frustrated: We dun need to find someone to be able to sit

But as we kept walking, there really was no people in sight, can we just sit at someone’s unattended house or shop? We tried to crawl into the gates of someone’s mansion, both enticed by the chance of nobody appearing and half expecting someone to show up and explain the phenomenon of this lonesome town

There were loud barks

No way, could it be the wolves? I have heard wolves can swim if the pool isn’t too deep

My legs stood like a tree and I bend my vision until I see the incoming army

Three fat dogs quickly came, but they didn’t bite, they just show their tongues and wag their tails

The barking sound felt so loud because the town was just so quiet

I was grabbing my bag of coins without realizing it and realized I couldn’t use them in this deserted town

We followed the dogs into the mansion living room, we enjoy the comfy chairs and rosy lit lamps

Gong started to interact more with the dogs and the dogs were in turn excited

I searched the sinister mansion without lights, and found bones and meat, I took them all out and gave the hounds and ourselves a feast

The night falls on our head, and we realized nobody is coming home, more and more questions started to cram my thoughts, I couldn’t sleep, I didn’t want to, I want to figure out why... this town is abandoned

Gong was hugging the dogs, sleeping together on the big pillow

Trying to take a break from my maze of thoughts, I walked outside the windows, expecting a clue or two, but nothing, nobody, no lights, no trees, just walls and nice residences

Days passed, we explored the town
Days passed, we got drunk
Days passed, the dogs started to follow us everywhere
Days passed, we found some tasty ham
Days passed, days passed

Me: Maybe we should return to our village
Gong: Are you being serious? Winter is already here, we can’t brave the journey with guts alone

Just as he spoke, white flakes started to zig zag downwards to our hair

Me: If the townspeople returned, we would be branded as thieves, what we had took and ate, this bag of coins won’t save us

Gong: Are you delusional? What people?

Indeed, the streets is so silent, you can’t even hear footsteps

Gong was fighting with a dog over a bone

I saw and pointed at the new merchant canoe: That wasn’t here previously

We headed there to sastify our curiousity, we then saw a dead body

Gong: Oh shucks! Pirates, we have to leave

I looked closer, but it just didn’t felt like a stab wound, his whole body were slashed with something big, like a scythe

Me: Where’s your scythe?
Gong looked at me sillily: The scythe is at the other side of river, I can’t possibly swim and carry it at the same time
Me thinking: Whatever it is, it is better if we return to our secret mound hut

Gong dragged the corpse out of the canoe and started paddling, I looked at the distant dogs bewildered at our departure

When we landed back at our land, we carried the canoe over our shoulders and put it on land, afraid of the river swallowing it

Clear snow carpeted the grassfields and tree canopies, we passed by a few snow boulders and found they were wolves corpses, could they been hungered to death? Or were they simply hibernating?

Gong kept shaking at the wolves, but they showed no response whatsoever

The sucking wind was pulling the barren trees, the sound whipped like a lashing over and over again

“Help”

“Help”

Can’t tell was it the wind making noise, or was someone asking for help

Gong got spooked, he pointed me to come over, there was someone inside the snow covered bush

A bleeding arm caught us by surprise
Injured man: Blak? Gong?

It took us some eye concentration before we realise we are talking to Ase, he always wanted to be a guard, what is he doing here?

Ase: You cannot return to village
I slowly whispered: Why?
Ase: There are werewolves
Usually we would laugh at this point, but Ase’s body were slashed like the previous victim in the boat, werewolf or pirate, this would be a dangerous enemy

Gong became angry: What actually happened? We are going to bring you back to the village for help

Ase: The legend is true and now we shall hide

We got shocked by his next action, he used a familiar looking scythe and ended his remaining life

Me: It is your scythe
Gong: What just happened?
Me: He was already half a dead man
Me: Whatever killed him wasn’t after food

Gong took the black bloodied scythe and went back to the canoe

The ghastly blood dripped from the scythe’s tip, but my mind was occupied with other thoughts, how did the werewolves found our rural village?

Could our footprints led the enemy to our doorstep? But we walked on tall grasses, and the snow would have covered any tracks

Could our dirty stench from no showering at the hidden mound create a path of trace? But the forest had always smelled

Gong: Are you coming on board or not?

I sniffed on my sleeves, wielding my sword: We need to warn the villagers

Gong: Guess not

Gong rowed away like a cold hearted bitch

Tightening my grip on the sword, I gain resolute in my action, if the demons would find the village, they would slay, and if the demons find the secret mound, they would annihilate

I walked like a brave man in the snow, the sun lingered onto my head as no leaves in the winter block the rays

Not long, I see tall aliens roaming the empty village, they moved like squids and had helmet of furs, their eyes were rage, and they prowl everywhere, the werewolves, as the legend said

The tall werewolves howl like angry mobs, they couldn’t find meat or victims, they bashed their heads onto the doors and windows

I slowly walked backwards, I am no match for 10 or more of these elites, three times my height, claws longer than my hand

I circled a longer route towards the hidden mound, at here is the fairy lake, the dense fog reduces visibility, I could walk freely without being followed

Six red eyes glowed in the distance, they could sniff me

I started running

I have no idea where I am running towards in the mist

When I stopped, I was already at the secret mound

I am a fool, I could have lead the evil straight into our secret hideout

But no matter how much I banged on the wooden door, it wouldn’t opened, finally a pinhole flips out and an eye sees me, next, the door swung open

Elder Omo: Next time you are this late, I wouldn’t open the door for you

I nodded but he didn’t let me pass

Elder Omo: Where is Gong?
Me: He stayed at riveria city
Elder Omo shoved me backwards and locked the door, opened the pinhole and said: You can’t enter until you bring him back

I spoke in my mind: Bastard

Gong seems like one without parents, but he did have, until they disappeared, just like those werewolves killing humans rumours

This is why, Gong keeps hanging around me

Now that I thought about it, I realized Gong could still be finding his parents, that is why he did not return, it was not fear but fearlessness

The secret mound is like a big sign of inviting unwanted attention, thus, I moved away, to the lotus swamp, hoping the stench would cover my presence

Although there were no red eyed visitors, every night, there are ruckus and shouting from inside the earthly mound

&lt; Inside the mound &gt;

It was dark and only one had a lamp, a matchstick flicked, and there were silent horror

Children bodies are laid on the floor, their blood leaving their body, sipping into the earthly ground

Guard Soi: What is happening?
Elder Omo looked dizzy: I am afraid the werewolves are within the compound

They were smart enough to ban torches and lamps, so the mound stayed hidden, but not realizing, this leads to crime or enemies hiding in the dark, doing whatever they wishes to do

Elder Omo and three guards including Soi made everyone stood in rows, their hands on each other shoulders, ensuring nobody skips their body check

At the tenth check, Elder Omo was surprised at the amound of fur one had

Villager: Just long hair sir
Elder Omo: We dun call people sir here

Immediately the guards pinned the suspect down on the ground, the furry suspect started to break his knees and arms, they became extended and claws started to protrude out

With long fangs and red eyes staring at Elder Omo, the werewolf said: Ruff! Ruff!

Trembling with nervousness, the guards started to stab the unholy werewolf, it looked like in a fish market where fishes gets gutted and chopped

Elder Omo: Kill him

Elder Omo with his bad sight realized he was late in sending commands, the werewolf was already slain

The organs, heart and intestines spilled out of the werewolf just like any humans would, the similarity of body structure with humans makes the viewers uncomfortable

There were shouting in the shadowy back: Someone ran! I put my hand on his shoulders but he left!

Everyone started panicking, it was a mental asylum, the guards have no more control of the crowd, nobody could see and organize the scene

Bam! Bam! Bam!

Finally, someone opened the locked door

The settlers went out of the round mound so that they could see, and feel safe

I kept watching and watching, waiting for my granny

The mist becomes watery and the villagers are like jumping beans, nobody knew what to do

This is when you realized, the werewolves have been ambushing outside the compound all along, they were lying flat underneath the thorny bushes, they started to jump out and clawed the residents

This area is no longer the safe house we knew, people are running in different directions, hoping to get lucky, hoping the other people in other directions gets unlucky instead

I can’t just leave at the shuttering nightmare, my granny will not be able to make it

There she is, I yelled: Granny!

Granny walked towards my shouting like a tortoise, I then dragged her faster, towards the lotus swamp, hoping the werewolves can’t swim

Granny and I managed to find refuge at lotus swamp but seeing all the residents getting slayed one by one brings the chill out of me, I can’t just swim here and hide underneath this chaotic madness

I walked out of the swamp, and swung my sword, flipping the dirt away

A werewolf came towards me, this is when I realized it is three times taller than me, my legs started to freeze like ice cubes, I could at least swing my sword but my attack range was so short I could almost hear the werewolf laugh

Guard Soi from a far distance was in damaged state, but he is still standing, it meant he had killed a werewolf in combat

With a last, shivering breath, Guard Soi screamed like a night hawk, all the demons’ attention turned towards him, and they ran towards him including the werewolf that was going to kill me

All I could see was large black shadows hopping and flying at Guard Soi, he was torn into shreds, you can’t even see a body part from him anymore

This is when I realized my stupidity and arrogance, I shouldn’t fight, I went running back to the lotus swamp, I returned to the center of smelly swamp to reunite with granny

The foggy mist crawled like a surfing wave, it felt like it was helping to conceal our presence but the water waves tells a different story

Granny: Something is heading towards us, something big

I took out my sword and spun it like a spinning top, slashing clouds and water vapours

Granny suddenly got pulled downwards the swamp, something got her

I dived in and saw the swimming werewolf, never would have expected werewolves to be able to swim, but this was indeed not a deep pool

I kept carving wounds into the werewolf while the beast attack movements seems slowed due to their gigantic size against the swamp water friction

I swam towards the nightmarish face and stabbed his neck, the werewolf stopped moving and floating upwards

Granny started to pull me upwards, afraid I couldn’t breathe

Metal arrows were shooting everywhere, some humans even got stabbed by the blind projectiles

But many of the iron arrows found their heads into the chests of giant werewolves

We are clueless, this is a rural village, there are no army here or bow-wielding peasants, unless they came from beyond the territory

And indeed, we see unfamiliar red armoured bowman hiding behind trees, shooting at the vile demons in a graceful, practiced manner

Because they are not from our territory, we would not know if they are bandits or territory invaders, our best option is to swim north

Because it was a short swamp, we got out and started running

Even up and down the slopes of hilly forest, white knights managed to cornered us

Granny: Mercy!

I looked at Granny and then at the knights’ covered faces, not knowing what to do

A knight: We need to kill you, you could be a werewolf
Granny: We aren’t werewolves

It was a stupid conversation I thought

A knight: Werewolves can shapeshift, dun you know?
Granny: Mercy!

It turned out that my granny was the smarter one, if I had dared to draw my sword, my head would have fell off, I was no match for 10 horseback armoured knights

They tied us with thick ropes against the thick tree trunks

Me: Granny?
Granny was so quiet, I could hear the crickets sing
Me: Granny?

The knights were already far off, and suddenly granny appeared in front of me, when she was supposed to be tied up in another tree

Granny with her six packs
Granny with her long poking ears

Granny with her large mouth and protruding jaws

She immediately snipped apart the ropes bounding me, her hands was swollen red, and she just seems abnormally large, how did she even break out of her ropes?

An iron arrow flew like a hornet towards my granny’s chest entering from her back, granny’s mouth spit blood onto my face

She begin to transform, turning more and more red-face, angry, and bigger, her fur almost covering her wounds and her disheveled face

Then a horseback knight came from behind her back and swooped off her neck, granny was no more

I looked upwards, waiting for my doom, a shiny blade landed on my neck, scratching me uncomfortably

I breathed deeply, maybe this is a good place to rest, the tall pine trees felt so serene

Knight: Get up, you fool!

I then had to run with the 10 horseback knights towards our secret mound

&lt; Inside the mound &gt;

The guards managed to slay a few werewolves, however, the werewolves outside were barraged by the red armoured bowmans, so they all went inside the secret mound

The guards were outnumbered 10 to 100 werewolves, they came in and dined the residents like pancakes with strawberry syrup

At the center of corona, the tallest and biggest werewolf appeared and make a speech, surprisingly, apparently, some werewolves are able to speak like humans

Ancient one: You can join us, or you could die
Residents: How do we join you? We are not werewolves

The ancient one smiled with a big dark mouth: Taste my blood, this is all it takes to become one

The residents went straight to pledge their loyalty to the canine pack, unknowingly became cursed to become a werewolf, however, currently, their transformation are still too weak to be of any practical use

The red armoured bowmen bowed at the incoming 10 horseback knights, and pointed at the secret dome, I was dragged inside the battlefield shelter too

The knights had to leave their horses outside as the ceiling was too low, they raised their lanterns and see all are human civilians, dead and alive ones

Knight: I know some of you are werewolves, so we will be tying up everyone here until we are safe

The 100+ humans’ veins buldged like serpents, they immediately turned into werewolves and swarming the fully armoured knights

I was so scared that I used my tiny sword and scratch as many transforming werewolves as I can, interesting, the werewolves stopped transforming

A gigantic dark beast bashed me to the walls

When I sat up, I couldn’t see my sword

Ancient one: Where did you get this sword?
Me: Give me back my sword
Ancient one: It have the power to undo the curse of becoming werewolves
Me: Give me back my sword
Ancient one: But it is broken, you lost the top half of it, its blessing powers got damaged, and now, it can kill werewolves with a scratch

The werewolves hearing these starting to fall onto their knees and stopped breathing

The knights kept on fighting with the horde of werewolves while the evil lord walked meancingly towards me, he dragged me up in the air: Where is the other half?

Me: I dun have the other half
Ancient one: I want to break my curse!

Fearing for the knights safety after so long has passed, the red armoured bowmen entered the compound, unfortunately, it just looked like a scarlet graveyard, the knights had fallen

Iron arrows started piercing through the skulls and arms of the werewolves and untransformed werewolves (humans)

The ancient one started rolling like a cannonball, squashing the armoured army like swiss cheese

It was no doubt, that the ancient one is the real combatant here, the other 100+ werewolves here are merely his cursed servants, being used as sacrificial shields in battle

I got dragged across the shaved yellow fields, now turning into dirty weeds and melting snow

It was a weird scene, 100+ werewolves and one human hanging out in the fields

Me: Here, here

The werewolves started to dig around the spot I pointed, and indeed, the other half of the sword was found

One month later, everyone was uncursed, half lived at the fields, the other half at riveria city, the secret buried
Break time

Break time is just an experiment, it is a useful to pace myself in between stories, writing and reading

I can talk about anything, including off topics

For this page, I am talking more about my hobbies, I have been creating text based games, reading and writing stories, initially, as a way to improve english, but it has grown to the point, it have the biggest positive impact on my life, it makes time more meaningful, improves my memory, helps me rethink life and problems

But one fateful day, I have a huge conflict with the text based games admins and participants, it was then that I quitted the website, it had to do with the categorization of games and that the admins doesn’t knows how to play or solve non-parser games, eventually, I make new accounts and hide under them

It shows that it is not necessary fruitful to overparticipate in certain hobbies because of its draconic community or rules, but we have fully averted the issue by placing games in sandpit and and new usernames avoiding all unwanted attention and overexpectation
