&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Granny whispered, leaning closer, "You can take a break if you want."</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Your scrawny body and dripping sweat mixed with tears, "Can't leave you to do all of the work."</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Scratch, scratch, and scratch,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">you scythed through the yellow fields of abundance</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">every year, on this month,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">all the villagers get busy</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">In mid-September, the sun's heat feels especially relentless, scorching everything in its path.</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Nanny plucked the plunder into straw beds and loaded them onto carriages.</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">And, mind you,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">We have no horses</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">We are the "horses"</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">We pulled the big and silly old wagon through the densely packed forests,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">heading down a secretive and narrowing earth pathway,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">until we can no longer see the entrance of this hidden dungeon</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">_________________________________</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Nanny held your hands, "It's dangerous out there."</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">You shrugged with unhappiness, "I don't believe in the outlandish rumors."</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Nanny (Hands over a scythe): Still dangerous alone</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">The super crowded hidden dungeon has a low ceiling and many busy noises from the incoming </span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">settlers.</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">You: It's squeezy, hot, and I can't breathe in here</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Nanny: And there's no shower</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Together: For one whole month!</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">You bid farewell to your tough grandma and started exploring the wilderness.</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">It is said that the Far East has pleasant towns.</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">But too many long blades of grass fields are sheathing the view.</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Only when you stop cutting through the grass,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">then could you hear</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">low growls</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">and stealthy footsteps,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">you are not alone</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">_________________________________</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">When you had almost reached your destination,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">A long river dashed your hopes,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">and on your forested side,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">wolves with giant white furs were gathering in strength and hunger</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Stuck in the middle,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">all alone</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">You: Should've listened to the nanny</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">The beautiful city walled by the river seems to be calling for you,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">opulent mansions and purple grapevines silhouetted like a wall painting</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Flinging your scythe at the wolves hiding near the bushes makes them panic and fall back for a </span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">few seconds.</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Taking the opportunity,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">you dive into the blue river, unaware of any dangerous presence lurking beneath your waist</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Luckily, your muscles didn't let you drown.</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">You reached the dream port town, and everything is sparkling new,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">marble streets,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">wall with vibrant colors,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">multi-story brick mansions</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Ship merchants that came to your small village have always told of their port town,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">but none of their words could paint such a beautiful image that you are seeing today</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">_________________________________</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">When the sun has dried your clothes,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">and your skin turned into flakes</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">You: I need a place to sit</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">But as you kept walking, you could see no sight of a resting place... nor people.</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">You: Where is everyone?</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">There were loud barks at you.</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Wolves can't possibly swim, can they?</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Your legs become numb, and you spin around your torso like a tree-climbing lizard,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">it's just dogs</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Their noises were dramatized by the silence of this eerily silent town.</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Looking at the coins in your palms,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">you realized they were of no use</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">You: Maybe the town citizens believed in the werewolf rumors, too. Why else would they leave </span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">this fantastical place?</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">You become hysterical with nobody to chat with, and the whole werewolf legend slowly sips </span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">past your mind.</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Initially forced to survive,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">you barged into other residences and ate some loaves of bread,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">then, you took some grape juice,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">and today, you are smoking some ham</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">The thieving adrenaline has turned into boredom exploration.</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">You: Maybe it is time to head back</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">You: It's been many days, the wolves would have been gone away by now</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">_________________________________</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Stealing a small merchant canoe, you unwittingly became a pirate.</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Astoundingly, the wolves were still here</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">But they have turned into carcasses,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">but their big white fur is still attached,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">usually, hunters would sell that for a hefty coin bag,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">whoever did it was desperate</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">or, wasn't human</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">The crazy wind was whipping against the reddening trees,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">You: Should I move back?</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">A creepy voice called out your name from the bushes,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">nobody should know your name around here,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">all of your home villagers should be hanging out at the hidden dungeon</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Your curiosity was piqued, and you stepped closer and closer.</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">A black arm shoved in front of your face from the bushes.</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">You can't make out what you are seeing until it starts talking.</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Ash: Do not return home</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Holy, your friend has been massacred by a wild pack of animals,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">You don't even dare to bring him back home, afraid of splitting his injured body apart.</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">You (Anger): What happened? Who did this to you?</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Ash: The legend is true. And now the werewolves know our secret hideout.</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Ash used the nearby scythe and ended his life.</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Afraid of your life, you took the scythe and shouldered on.</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">_________________________________</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">As you walked back to your tiny canoe,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">you started thinking about all the possibilities that have gone wrong,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">your footsteps led the werewolves into the secret house</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">You: Unlikely, because I am skinny and leave almost no footprints</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Your smell lingered in the air, and then the werewolves traced it.</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">You: No, because I am heading in the opposite direction</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">the hot September plus the no shower plus crowding with many unwashed villagers has created </span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">a stench for you,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">that leads the demons back into your backyard</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Sniffing your sleeves,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">You: Possible</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Tightening your scythe, you know you cannot abandon your people.</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">No matter what had happened</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Jogging in the darkness with the canopy's shroud,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">you stopped hesitating and prowled your way back home</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Hiding behind a giant trunk,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">images of werewolves twice as tall as you,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">were damaging the villages,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">they were enraged,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">that is good because it means they have not found the secret basement yet</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Four red eyes hiding inside bushes tracking this lone scythe-wielder</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">...</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">_________________________________</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">A dense fog started crawling on four sides of the forest,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">taking the opportunity, you headed back into safety.</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Banging onto the metallic door, the door finally swung open,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">you and two more lost villagers followed you into the hut,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">one elderly required you to explain your bloody scythe,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">and when you explained about the werewolf attack, his eyes became bigger</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Elderly Ion: Lock the gate, and do not let anyone in anymore</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Children: What's happening</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Elderly Ion: The werewolves are here</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">At night, the sanctuary turned into a crime scene,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">some villagers have gone missing,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">they have banned torches and lamps for it would make the hut visible to the enemies,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">but in this darkness,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">they can't tell if the enemies have infiltrated the yard</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">You walked with the volunteer "guards" to surveil any threats,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">but everyone looked dirty with some blood</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">You: This isn't working, but there were two that came into the hut with me on the last entry</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Guards (Pointing finger): Is it them?</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Realizing the guards and scythe-wielder are heading in their direction,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">the tall humans sprung into werewolves,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">their muscles trembling with nervousness</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">_________________________________</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">RUFF RUFF !!</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">RUFF RUFF !!</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">The loud sounds traveled past the doors.</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">You penetrated your scythe into one of them, and the organs spilled out.</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">The other guards held onto the other werewolf, and a knife was stabbed into its abdomen.</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">It was no longer a safe house,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">everyone went mad and opened the doors,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">watery mist and lost villagers were jumping beans</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">You couldn't find your nanny in this dark place or the foggy outside,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">you are left with no choice except for self-preservation</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">But your legs are frozen with fear of what is going to happen to your poor old nanny then,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">your mind has taken over control of your unwilling body</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">You: If I have to die, let it be worth</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">With a last, shivering breath, you screamed like a night hawk.</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">The sound vibrations pierced through the eardrums of the merciless beasts,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">they let go of their bounty and went straight for your head</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Even in the foggy mist, you can feel footsteps closing towards you.</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Spinning like a Beyblade, your scythe was able to slice through some foes,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">but the shadows in the mist became more and more</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">_________________________________</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">The day broke, and the mist barrier was disappearing.</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Finally, standing face to face the nightmarish faces,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Zip Zip Zip</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Zip Zip Zip</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">The sound of metal arrows was launched,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">The werewolves flinched backward with their hairy chests full of stabs.</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">You quickly squatted down into the descending mist and headed toward the yellow fields,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">All by yourself</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Quiet as a cricket</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Step by step, you continued marching further away.</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">When you looked upwards,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">a shiny sword pointed toward your throat,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">you smiled gracefully at the holy knight</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">The men smiled and knew you were not a shapeshifting werewolf,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">otherwise, you would not be smiling</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Then you frowned</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">You: My nanny!</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">The knight heaved his horse and rode back into the battle zone, unassumingly to find your </span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">nanny.</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">When you continued to explore the yellow maze,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">you found your granny</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Cut cut cut cut cut</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Cut cut cut cut cut</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">You: Nanny?</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Nanny with her six-packs</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Nanny and her long poking ears,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Nanny and her large mouth and protruding jaws,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Granny: What?</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Together, you continued to help Granny clear the weeds.</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">Inside the hidden dungeon,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">The guards managed to slew a few werewolves,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">but the guards were kids, after all,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">when the mightiest werewolves stepped into the corona,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">they were quickly fallen,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">the tall and ancient werewolf grabbed the best-dressed guard up into the air,</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">unable to move</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">"Ancient One": Do you want to be a werewolf?</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">It spoke like a wolf trying to speak the human language.</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">The end</span>&#91;/p&#93;

&#91;p&#93;<span class="bbcode-size-18">.</span>&#91;/p&#93;
